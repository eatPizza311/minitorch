# minitorch

[MiniTorch](https://minitorch.github.io/) is a DIY teaching library for machine learning engineers who wish to learn about the internal concepts underlying deep learning systems. 
It is a pure Python re-implementation of the [Torch](https://pytorch.org/) API designed to be simple, easy to read, tested, and incremental. 
The final library can run Torch code.

Individual assignments cover:
- ML Programming Foundations
- Autodifferentiation
- Tensors
- GPUs and Parallel Programming
- Foundational Deep Learning

The project was developed by [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) ([@srush_nlp](https://twitter.com/srush_nlp)) with Ge Gao, Anton Abilov, and Aaron Gokaslan.
